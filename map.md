I've been thinking about about medium sized groups and how they might like to use digital systems. So I've been thinking about the group of guides at Outback Adventures at UCSD and how we are a group of ~40 active members. In the past I floated the idea of some sort of collective google maps account combined with a wiki where we could put together a list of secret spots to share just amongst ourselves, but that didn't catch on and I don't think it really was the greatest idea. Required too much buy-in maybe.

My next idea struck me as a lot more fun. Thinking about the strengths of our group and our shared love of person-to-person interaction, it seems there is a space for some kind of digital augmentied conversation starter.

What if we had a shared map (think d3 geo visualizations), which had highlights on it indicating areas where people within the group had been as a way of indicating where someone within our outback group had first hand experience going. It's then also easy to think of adding in another kind of highlight where someone could share a desire to visit a place, and then it'd be easy for anyone else in the group at our weekly meeting to start up a conversation with whoever it was that indicated a knowledge of an area they are interested in. Or for groups to form a little trip out to a destination of shared interest.

This type of system specifically targets groups of about our size. Any smaller and that group doesn't really need this kind of digital assistant, as they probably already know eachother that well. Any larger and it probably indicates a friend group that isn't as close as ours. In the middle, at ~40 people, this type of information sharing would be a fun way to learn about eachother and spark up conversations of trips or past memories.


So in the spirit of Bret Victor, who got a name for himself being the one who at the end of every design meeting had a working prototype up and running, I want to make this and do it as simply and quickly as possible. Helps that it is intentionally a simple system. Nothing more than a little map highlighter with a list of names available upon selecting any highlighted zone.

Think this kind of visualization, but maybe more fine areas. Like how political maps do counties. Maybe we could do counties in some areas (like utah) or state parks as the area of selection. Or something like that

Got a little idea for you, would be fun to think about. Especially in the context of the Design Lab's focus on "Socio Technical systems" so much as of late (I know that's been the long-term theme, but I hadn't given it much thought until recently)

Responses:
  - let photo albums be the data input. People could just upload the photos from their trip and gps data could be extracted from each photo and a string between those points would likely be a good quick and easy aproximation of the trip locations.
